Initial nmap scan:
![Nmap screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/troll/nmap.PNG)

Running services:
* FTP on port 21
* OpenSSH on port 22
* Webserver on 80

**Testing FTP (Port 21)**
*Version vsftpd 3.0.2*

So testing FTP we can login as anonymous.

There's a pcap file to open in wireshark, after taking a look through it for a minute we can see there's a clue on where to look next.

**Testing OpenSSH (Port 22)**
*Version OpenSSH 6.6.1p1*

Nothing.

**Testing Webserver (Port 80)**
*Version httpd 2.4.7*

Opening the site in firefox:

Please no more memes.

Running the usual combo of dirb/nikto.

Robots has lots of clues too.

Unfortunately most of them are red herrings as you can see below.

There's a lot of this stuff. 

Using the clue we found from FTP we can find a directory.

This contains a file, checking with binwalk we can see it's an executable.

Running strings on it gives us a hint: "Find address 0x0856BF to proceed"

I am going to now pretend I didn't spend a signficant amount of time trying lots of ridiculous things to try and read this out of memory when the program was running etc...

...turns out it's just a URL to hit..

Took me a good few minutes to work out what was going on here. Using those names and that password got us nowhere. Turns out the password literally is the filename "Pass.txt". We've now got an SSH shell.

**Privilege Escalation: Kernel exploit method**

Checking the kernel version.

We've got a few options in searchsploit.
![Searchsploit screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/troll/searchsploit.PNG)

I try downloading these to /tmp/, compiling with gcc and executing, but there's a time out that disconnects us, and /tmp/ seems to get wiped down each time.

![Shell screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/troll/shell2.PNG)

After a couple of attempts with different kernel exploits, we get root using [this](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37292/) exploit.

Info on vuln [CVE-2015-1328](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1328):
{% highlight plaintext %}
The overlayfs implementation in the linux (aka Linux kernel) package before 3.19.0-21.21 in Ubuntu through 15.04 does not properly check permissions for file creation in the upper filesystem directory, which allows local users to obtain root access by leveraging a configuration in which overlayfs is permitted in an arbitrary mount namespace.

**Privilege Escalation: Cronjob method**

We can root using a cron job running as root which calls a a world writable python file (/lib/log/cleaner.py) by just add the account directly to the sudoers file. This also seems to be the same file that wipes down /tmp/

Here's what I did to the file to get root:
