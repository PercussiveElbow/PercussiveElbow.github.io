Initial nmap scan:
![Nmap screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/nmap.PNG)

Running services:
* FTP on port 20/21
* OpenSSH on port 22
* Domain on 53
* Webserver on 80
* NetBIOS on 139
* Something called Doom on 666
* MySQL on 3306

**Testing FTP (Port 21)**
*Version vsftpd 2.0.8*

Connecting to FTP service we see a banner referencing a likely user 'Harry'.
![FTP screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/ftp.PNG)

It appears the service allows anonymous logins.
![FTP screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/ftp1.PNG)

There's a note file we can download, referencing another possible username 'Elly'
![FTP screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/ftp2.PNG)

<br>

**Testing OpenSSH (Port 22)**
*Version OpenSSH 7.2p2*

Nothing exploitable, however we do find another username which could be useful.

![SSH screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/ssh.PNG)

<br>

**Testing Domain (Port 53)**
*Version dnsmasq 2.75*

Nothing.

<br>

**Testing Webserver (Port 80)**


![HTTP screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/http.PNG)


Running the usual combo of nikto and dirb leads us nowhere unfortunately, other than weirdly finding .bashrc and .profile files, but these don't seem to contain any clues.
![HTTP screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/nikto.PNG)

![HTTP screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/dirb.PNG)

It's really strange that there doesn't appear to be anything since the http server is usually the best place to exploit in a lot of the VMs I've done so far.

I did find I could seemingly run put using tftp, but every time I tried to upload something I got a timeout error, so I guess it had some weird IP whitelisting going on or filetype excluding?
(Note: trying this later on seemed to work fine, I'm not sure what originally was preventing it)
<br>

**Testing NetBIOS (Port 139)**
*Version Samba smbd 4.3.9-Ubuntu*

Running enum4linux gives us tons of usernames to add to our list.

<br>

![Netbios screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/netbios.PNG)

**Testing DOOM (Port 666)**

Getting a lot of broken characters when we nc to this service, and when we try via HTTP in browser.
![DOOM screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/666.PNG)
![DOOM screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/6661.PNG)

Using file to work out that it's a zipped file, then uncompressing.

![DOOM screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/6662.PNG)

Another username to add to the list.

![DOOM screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/6663.PNG)

<br>

**Testing MySQL (Port 3306)**
*Version MySQL 5.7.12-0ubuntu1*

![MySQL screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/mysql.PNG)

![MySQL screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/mysql2.PNG)

**Back to Nmap**

After this I was stumped for quite a while, I had a list of users but nothing else to help me, so I went back to the start and ran nmap again, this time running a much wider scan.

![Nmap screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/nmap1.PNG)

A service we didn't see before, running on 12380!.

<br>

**Testing webserver (Port 12380)**
*Version httpd 2.4.18*

It appears there's a webserver running. However we just get a coming soon page.

Running dirb doesn't find anything.

![HTTP screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/12380dirb.PNG)

Nikto does however.

![HTTP screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/12380nikto.PNG)

I realised dirb found nothing because I was specifying HTTP, anything more than the coming soon page only seems to be served up on HTTPs here

It seems that nikto was finding things on https instead, I had specified http on dirb, doing it again points us to phpmyadmin but not much more.

Noting Zoe user being referenced in the source code again.

![HTTP screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/12380source.PNG)


Phpmyadmin.

![HTTP screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/phpmyadmin.PNG)


Checking in robots.txt gives us two big clues.
![HTTP screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/12380robots.PNG)


![HTTP screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/admin112233.PNG)
Make that one clue...


Wordpress my old friend.

![HTTP screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/blogblog.PNG)
![HTTP screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/wpscan.PNG)

Running WPScan:
![HTTP screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/wpscan1.PNG)

Checking the wpcontent directory for other possible vectors.
![HTTP screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/wpcontent.PNG)
![HTTP screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/wpcontent2.PNG)

There's some plugins, lets check them.
First one has an LFI exploit, we can use it to grab files from the VM.
![HTTP screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/searchsploit.PNG)

It appears to grab the file and include it a new jpg file in a blog post, then we can just download it and cat it as plaintext.
![HTTP screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/wpmethod.PNG)

(Note: I globally disabled cert checking on python here for a quick fix. DO **NOT** DO THIS. My Kali VMs are temporary, I spin a new one up with vagrant after each box.)

Lets grab config as it should have credentials, and /etc/passwd for users.
We have a password for root (plbkac)
![HTTP screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/wpconfig.PNG)

Lets get the users on the VM while we're at it.

**Getting a shell**

There seems to be a few methods to get a shell.

**Bruteforcing SSH**

So we've got a password from the php credentials, and a list of users. Using SSH Bruteforcer we can see if any of the users we know about share the password we found. I know we can use Hydra for this, but I wanted to try a new tool.

![SSH Bruteforce screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/sshbruteforce.PNG)
It worked, we got a ssh session as user Zoe.
![shell screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/shell.PNG)

**Cracking wordpress hashes**

Using those credentials we found earlier, I log into phpmyadmin and download the wp_users table. Similarly you can do this via mysql.

Cleaning up the hashes csv export with a line I stole from StackOverflow (because I still haven't read the man page for awk)
![wphashes screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/wphashes.PNG)

I started up johntheripper (after trying to get hashcat working on cpu only mode for ages) and left it to it for a LONG time. Finally I got some credentials for wordpress, I tried logging on  with them, when I got on as admin I uploaded a reverse shell and caught it with nc.
![johnripper screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/johnripper.PNG)

**Bruteforcing with WPScan**

Same method as above, just using wpscan to bruteforce the login.
![wpbrute screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/wpbruteforce.PNG)

**Shell via MySQL**

I didn't find this one myself, only after getting root another way and looking to see how others had done it. Basically you get a shell going through SELECT INTO OUTFILE. I'll definitely be using this in the future.

**TFTP**

Using tftp we can upload a shell directly, hit it in our browser and get a shell as www user.

<br>

**Privilege Escalation**

Once I have a shell (as Zoe, I didn't try priv escalation as any other users so I'm sure there are different methods too) I did the usual, checking .bash_history (empty), cron, uname, running linenum and so on.

![Privilege Escalation screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/linenum.PNG)

**Method 1**

According to searchsploit we've got a escalation we can use with this combo of Ubuntu and it's kernel, I download it from exploitdb, host it on my attacking VM and pull it on Stapler (I keep any vulnhub VMs away from the internet).

Info on [the vuln: CVE-2016-4557](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-4557)

{% highlight c %}
The replace_map_fd_with_map_ptr function in kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel before 4.5.5 does not properly maintain an fd data structure, which allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (use-after-free) via crafted BPF instructions that reference an incorrect file descriptor.
{% endhighlight %}

![Privilege Escalation screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/privesc1.PNG)


**Method 2**

There's a world writable cron job running as root. As good practice, make sure you do this on all your production servers for double extra verygood security.

![Privilege Escalation screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/logrotate.PNG)

I add a line to add Zoe to the sudoers file, without needing a password, then simply run sudo su.
![Privilege Escalation screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/privesc2.PNG)

**Rooted**

And we have root.
![Root flag screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/stapler/rootflag.PNG)

Takeaways: Make sure to run an extensive nmap scan sooner rather than later, I spent ages stuck before doing a full port scan.
