Starting with an nmap scan, there's tons of stuff avaliable, including a webserver on 80, tomcat on 8080, ssh on 22, dovecot email on 110/995 and more.

Checking what the webservers are serving on both port 80 and port 8080. I checked any images with exiftools, and checked the source code for anything but neither proved useful.

I found a login for tomcat, I thought about bruteforcing it but continued on for now. I inteded to search for the specific tomcat 7 version to see if there was anything exploitable, but forgot about it and never came back as another method worked later on.

I ran nikto against both.

Then continued enumerating, running dirb.

Checking robots.txt on port 80 gives us some clues to what might be living on the server.

License is interesting, it seems the server is running something called builderengine, I've never heard of it so I do a little research.

Checking searchsploit shows us there's a way to arbitrarily upload files to the box. I upload a reverse shell, start netcat and then hit it in my browser, I tried to avoid using the metasploit module for this, I realised I hadn't been including /bin/bash/ when creating my php payload.

Uploading.

Checking some directories in netcat, it seems my user is www-data.

Checking kernel version for possible exploits.

(Note: I did get a full bash shell with python right after this, just wanted to get the important info straight away)

Found a flag in /var/www/.

While trying to escalate priviledges I spent quite a while fumbling around with dirtyc0w, two of the three exploits I found through searchsploit couldn't get to work, but I another PoC on
[github]( https://github.com/dirtycow/dirtycow.github.io/wiki/PoCs) did. I uploaded it via the same exploit I found earlier (just because my lab is segrated from touching the internet so I couldn't curl -O etc), browsed to /var/www/html/files/, compiled with gcc and then ran. This was **really** unstable and I had to restart the VM 3/4 times, but it didn't seem to do permanent damage to the VM. SSHing as firefart (as per the exploit default) after I ran it, but I basically only just had enough time to get to /root/ to find the other flag before the whole thing would crash.

Rooted

I later found a post suggesting running {% highlight ruby %}
echo 0 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_writeback_centisecs
{% endhighlight %}

 as soon as you got the shell would make the exploit stable, which it seemed to, I was able to play around on the box for a good 10-15 minutes after running it.


Takeaways: I feel kinda "cheaty" about using DirtyC0w, since I think this VM was made just before it was disclosed and I don't think it was the author's intended way to escalate. I might try and see what other ways there may be to gain root later. I barely even looked at the email server running on the server etc.
