Initial nmap scan:
![Nmap screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/billu/nmap.PNG)

Running services:
* OpenSSH on port 22
* Webserver on 80

Not much visible on the outside, so lets get started.

**Testing FTP (Port 21)**
*Version OpenSSH 5.9p1*

Nothing.

**Testing webserver (Port 80)**
*Version Apache httpd 2.2.22*

I must destroy all anime.

Running the usual nikto/dirb combo.

Ok, seems we have a few php files (index, test)

![Test screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/billu/test.php.PNG)

This looks like something, I play around with this in burp and find that there's a weird LFI injection vuln through this. By changing the method to POST, including application/x-www-form-urlencoded as a content type, and passing a file= parameter in the request, I can read any file the webserver can.

![etcpasswd screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/billu/etcpasswd.PNG)
Nice. List of users.

Using this I try to grab the source of a few of the php files I know about.

index.php:

I notice the imports in index and check those too.
![index screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/billu/index.php.PNG)

head.php:
![head screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/billu/head.php.PNG)

![head screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/billu/gstaticimage.PNG)

This head.php file contains a weird image embed, I check it out but it seems to be nothing (i ran exiftool on it just incase)

c.php:

![c screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/billu/c.php.PNG)

![phpmyadmin screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/billu/phpmyadmin.PNG)

These credentials in c.php let us logon to phpmyadmin, nice!


**Getting into the panel: PHPMyAdmin method**

I grab the users table.

![sqlusers screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/billu/sqlusers.PNG)


I throw these, along with the ones we grabbed earlier from /etc/passwd LFI into SSHBruteforce with the phpmyadmin pass, but no luck. (I tried again with the additional user/pass I find in a sec, but that doesn't work either.)

![sshbrute screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/billu/brutessh.PNG)

Checking the other tables I find what we're looking for.

![mysqlcreds screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/billu/mysqlpass.PNG)

Using these we can get logged into the next part of the site (panel.php)

**Getting into the panel: SQL Injection method**

I take a look at what my browser is sending in burp. Using the index.php file it's a little easier to perform some SQL Injection on this page.

![burp screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/billu/burp1.PNG)

I lost the screenshot somewhere along the way of what I put in burp to get the injection here, but it's not too difficult.

**Getting a shell through image upload**

Now that we're inside the panel area, lets try to get a shell.


Using the same LFI exploit I grab the source to panel.php.

![panel screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/billu/panel.php.PNG)

There seems to be two parts to this area, I can view existing users (including names and images) and create a new one.

The image upload part seems to check file type, so we can't upload a php shell outright.
![imgupload screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/billu/imageupload1.PNG)


Ok, so we're limited in what we can upload. I got stuck here for quite a while trying to hide a shell in an image, but finally got it.

![imgupload screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/billu/imageupload.PNG)

Using a guide from [here](https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/Hiding-Webshell-Backdoor-Code-in-Image-Files/) I embed a little backdoor in the comment EXIF tag of the captain jack image existing on the site, then I reupload it. Playing around with it in burp you can see I can execute commands, but it's a little messy, lets get an actual reverse shell.

![shell screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/billu/shell.PNG)

Netcat wasn't working, so I grabbed a python reverse shell, url encoded it, hit go in burp and caught it!

Creepy Captain Jack does not approve of your hax.

**Privilege Escalation**

Usually I try to find a way to escalate without using a kernel exploit etc, but I got lazy. Tried a couple and [this](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37292/) worked.

Info on exploit [CVE-2015-1328](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1328):
{% highlight plaintext %}
The overlayfs implementation in the linux (aka Linux kernel) package before 3.19.0-21.21 in Ubuntu through 15.04 does not properly check permissions for file creation in the upper filesystem directory, which allows local users to obtain root access by leveraging a configuration in which overlayfs is permitted in an arbitrary mount namespace.

**Rooted**
