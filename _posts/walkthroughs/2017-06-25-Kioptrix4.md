Initial nmap scan:
![Nmap screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/kioptrix/4/nmap.PNG)


Running services:

* OpenSSH on port 22
* Apache httpd on port 80
* NetBIOS on port 139/445

**Testing OpenSSH (Port 22)**
*Version 4.7p1*

Not much luck here.

<br>

**Testing Apache httpd (Port 80)**
*Version 2.2.38. PHP version 5.2.4 with Susosin Patch*


Checking the site in firefox, checking source then running dirb and nikto.
There's a login page we can see, the source shows the paramters used in the POST.

This login form is vulnerable to simple SQL Injection to bypass, at least we know there's a MySQL server running on the VM too.

Using these credentials we can SSH onto the VM.

We're in some kind of limited shell.

This bit took me quite a long time to work out, until I googled the exact syntax and found that we we're in a [lshell shell (shell-ception?)(https://github.com/ghantoos/lshell). We can break out of this by running echo os.system('/bin/bash') once we finally manage to type it out correctly..

Privilege escalation is below. Lets check the SQLInjection with sqlmap before we proceed.

I had trouble getting any info out of this even after putting up the level/risk, I think I just suck at sqlmap, I moved on and forgot to continue this bit.

**Testing SMB (Port 139)**
*Version 3.0.28a*

![enum4linux screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/kioptrix/4/enum4linux.PNG)

We find users root, john, loneferret, robert and nobody. Found a POC exploit that might affect this version but none with a payload.

**Testing SMB (Port 445)**
*Version 3.0.28a*

See above.

**Escalating privileges**

Now that we have a full shell we can try to run some exploits. Checking the kernel version.
![exploit screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/kioptrix/4/exploit.PNG)
![exploit2 screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/kioptrix/4/exploit2.PNG)

No gcc so can't compile exploits on the box, but compiling them on my machine (32bit) and copying, then running them there still didn't work.

Kernel version is vulnerable to same exploits as one of the previous Kioptrix.
e.g. [CVE-2009-2698](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2698).

{% highlight c %}

The udp_sendmsg function in the UDP implementation in 
(1) net/ipv4/udp.c and (2) net/ipv6/udp.c in the Linux
kernel before 2.6.19 allows local users to gain privileges
or cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference 
and system crash) via vectors involving the MSG_MORE flag and a UDP socket.
{% endhighlight %}


MySQL is running as root, if we can find a way to access it..

I spent a while looking for credentials... but then just tried mysql -u root outright and it worked first time, didn't even prompt me for a password. After I rooted and I looked around I did find that there were credentials I could have accessed earlier.

I spent a little while searching on how it's possible to get a root account from a root mysql process, turns out you can execute commands without much hassle (which isn't the same as \! commands, those run as your user in the shell) by calling sys_exec(''); assuming [this shared object](https://github.com/mysqludf/lib_mysqludf_sys) exists.

Using this I can easily make my user able to sudo to root. I wish I had knew this with one of the previous Kioptrix VMs, as I had mysql credentials on one of them I think, so it would have been a good way to escalate.

Ignore the missing semicolon.

![rooted screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vulnhub/kioptrix/4/rooted.PNG)
Rooted.
