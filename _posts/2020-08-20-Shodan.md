I recently had a go at developing a [Shodan library](https://github.com/PercussiveElbow/Shodan) for the Crystal programming language. John Matherly of Shodan fame was kind enough to try this out and mentioned it on the Shodan blog. You can check that out [here](https://blog.shodan.io/writing-a-subdomain-discovery-tool-in-crystal/).
