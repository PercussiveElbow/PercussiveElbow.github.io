First off lets run netdiscover and find the IP, then lets run nmap

SSH on port 22, but it's closed, Apache webserver running on port 80 and 443.

Lets visit the site:

A lot of effort must have went into this and it shows, including cool bootloader sequence and mini "shell". I tried all the commands but didn't find anything that I thought might be a clue.

Now that we've had a play around with that, lets check the source code, nothing stands out to me. I check /robots.txt and find the first key and something else.

Downloading this file reveals that it appears to be a wordlist:

Poking around manually some more in the site and source code reveals there's a wordpress installation, I found a login page but decided to hold off for a moment.

Lets do a bit more searching, running nikto and dirb:

Trying license.txt for info:

Funny

I tried admin/admin and other similar combinations on wordpress manually for a couple of minutes before I tried elliot who was messaging us on the first page. I got a message back indicating the account exists, so lets try to break into that. I tried using Burpsuite at first before realising the free version is rate limited for bruteforcing, so I went back to WPScan, using the wordlist we got earlier. It wasn't really finding anything so I had to remove duplicate entries from the file, running it again found it quickly.

We're in:
![Wordpress admin screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/mr_robot/wordpressadmin.PNG)

I opened metasploit, searched for the wp_admin_shell_upload module, and ran it.

![Metrepreter screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/mr_robot/meterpreter1.PNG)

We got a reverse shell back.

I spawn a shell with python. Searching around we find the second key, but we can't read it as we don't have access, there is a md5 hash password for an account robot though.

Searching for the hash online we find it's a simple string abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

We login as robot, then read the key.

Now we'll have to root, this bit took the longest for me, searching through CVEs and the files lying around but eventually did find that nmap runs as root.

Using the nmap interactive mode we can get a root shell

And the final key:
