Initial nmap scan:
![Nmap screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/kioptrix/2/nmap.PNG)

![Nmap screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/kioptrix/2/nmap2.PNG)

Nmap tells us that there's

* OpenSSH on port 22.
* Apache on port 80
* rpcbind on 111
* Apache (https) on port 443
* CUPS on port 631
* MySQL on port 3306

**Testing OpenSSH (Port 22)**
*Version 3.9p1*

Vulnerable to: [CVE-2003-0190](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/cve-2003-0190) which would help us enumerate users.

Might be vulnerable to [CVE-2016-3115](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-3115) if X11Forwarding=yes is set, but this would first require an authenticated user. From reading this I'm not sure if it just means breaking out from restricted shell commands

**Testing rpcbind (Port 111)**

Again think this is vulnerable to rpcbomb, but this doesn't help.

**Testing Apache (Port 80/443)**
*Version PHP 4.3.9, Apache 2.0.52*

Actual Apache HTTPd client doesn't have any vulnerabilities that will help us exploit.

[missing screenshot of login]

This login can be bypassed with some SQL Injection by entering: ' or 1=1 #.

I use this to ping localhost, then use pipe or && to run commands.

![whoami screenshot]({{ site.url }}/assets/kioptrix/2/whoami.PNG)

It's running commands as apache user.

Calling netcat in the query gets me a reverse shell.

Once I get a shell, I run uname -a then set up a python SimpleHTTP server and download linenum from my VM, I run it for some help on privilege escalation. It appears that the kernel is vulnerable to [CVE-2009-2698](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2698).

{% highlight c %}

The udp_sendmsg function in the UDP implementation in 
(1) net/ipv4/udp.c and (2) net/ipv6/udp.c in the Linux
kernel before 2.6.19 allows local users to gain privileges
or cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference 
and system crash) via vectors involving the MSG_MORE flag and a UDP socket.
{% endhighlight %}

I download an exploit I find in searchsploit (9542.c) in the same way, compile it with gcc and run it. **Root.**

**Testing CUPS (Port 631)**
*Version 1.1*

Probably vuln to [CVE-2008-5377](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-5377), could be useful for priv escalation. I tried wget -ing this when I had a shell and running it, but couldn't get it to work so I assume it was patched.


**Testing MySQL (Port 3306)**
*Version <= 5.0.11*

Decided to run sqlpmap on the webserver's sql injection vector.
It gives us users and passwords. I can't SSH with these. I initially thought it was maybe a hash, but I don't think they are now and are instead just sql credentials. I try to use mysql to logon, but it appears my IP isn't on the allowed list.
