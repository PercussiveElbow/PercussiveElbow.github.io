I like <a href="https://letterboxd.com/PercussiveElbow"> bad movies </a> and all things *sec. 

Recently completed my OSCP, you can find me hanging around on various infosec IRC/Discord channels.

I regularly hack away at CTFs, including OverTheWire, VulnHub and

When I get the time write up these CTFs under the blog.
